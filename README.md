# Africa COVID-19 Response Toolkit (ACRT) Community

The COVID-19 virus is spreading across the world like a wildfire across the globe, and now Africa.

We know from publicly available data that if urgent containment strategies are not implemented, the virus will spread quickly and get out of hand like in China, Italy, Spain, and now the US.

Coronavirus cases in Africa could surge from just thousands now (April 20, 2020) to 10 million within three to six months, according to provisional modelling by the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/africa-coronavirus-cases-hit-10-million-months-200417055006127.html). The World Bank predicts that Sub-Saharan Africa might be the region [hardest hit](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/impact-covid-19-coronavirus-global-poverty-why-sub-saharan-africa-might-be-region-hardest).

Africa needs an army of tech volunteers from around the world to help African ministries, hospitals, local manufacturers, local restuarants, and global organizations mitigate and help flatten the curve in Africa. Data collection/analysis/reporting, awareness dissemination, housing vacancy repoting, and survelliance for contact tracing can all be extremly helpful in assiting those in Africa. Software is needed, and that is where you, the community come in! Whatever skills you have: whether that's programming, product/project management, design, etc. there is a way for you to contribute.
