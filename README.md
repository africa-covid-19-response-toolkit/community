# Welcome to the Ethiopia COVID-19 Response Task Force Community

The COVID-19 virus is spreading across the world like a wildfire and Ethiopia has reported the first case on [March 13, 2020](http://www.moh.gov.et/ejcc/en/node/194). 

We know from publicly available data that if urgent containment strategies implemented are not implemented, the virus will quickly get out of hand like in China, Italy, Spain, and now the US.

Current projections, if left to its own devices, Ethiopia is roughly 19 - 23 days from reporting the 100th case and roughly 42 days behind Italy, which is considered the worst-case scenario.

We need an army of tech volunteers to help the Ethiopian Ministry of Health collect, analyze, and report to the agency so that we can assist them in the time of need. The better data collection/analysis/reporting there is, the better the response and the more effective the mitigation strategies will be. To do all this, software is needed, and that is where you come in! Whatever skills you have: whether that's programming, product/project management, design, etc. there is a way for you to contribute.
